**Green Cloud Demo** is your first step on how to migrate and optimize an existing Spring Boot application  to
https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift].  The migration guides you with the process of how to migrate Spring Boot workload form other platform 
to https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift], i.e. the build process, the ideal platform (https://www.openshift.com[OpenShift]), optimizing etc.,


== Short History of Microservices

.History of Microservices
image::./History_Of_Microservices.png[title=Short History of Microservices,align=center]

Most of the https://netflix.github.io/[Netflix OSS] components listed above are pretty old and optimized more for AWS, they are prone to some common DevOps
pain-points for organizations that are starting to adopt DevOps. The migration that will be done as part of this demo will help in alleviating those possible
DevOps pain-points and provide the organizations a direction on **How to migrate my Spring Boot Application to OpenShift**

== App Overview 
In this demo, the https://github.com/kameshsampath/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery] will be migrated 
and optimized for OpenShift, during the process of migration the original https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery]
will be modified to make it deployable on to https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] or https://www.openshift.com[Openshift].

The application will be migrated iteratively,

* [*] <<iteration-1>> - As-is deployment of the https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/brewery[Spring Cloud Samples - Brewery]
with no code change.  The Application build process will be modified to enable easier deployment of application on Openshift

* [*] https://redhat-developer-docs.github.io/green-cloud-demo/#iteration-2[Iteration-II] - Will use native OpenShift/Kubernetes features such as service discovery, loadbalancing & externalization of the config

* [*] https://redhat-developer-docs.github.io/green-cloud-demo/#iteration-3[Iteration-III], the current iteration - Optimizing stacks on OpenShift, like Apache Artemis instead of RabbitMQ, using OpenTracing and Jaeger

[[default-pre-req]]
== Pre-Requisite

You have a OpenShift cluster running locally using https://docs.openshift.org/latest/minishift/getting-started/index.html[*minishift*]
or https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/Op[*CDK*], or
have access to https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/index.html[*OpenShift Container Platform*]

Check the https://redhat-developer-docs.github.io/green-cloud-demo/#res-tools[Tools] section for more details

[WARNING]
====
- At least 7Gb of RAM is required to run the Brewery application, atleast for https://redhat-developer-docs.github.io/green-cloud-demo/#iteration-1[Iteration-I]
====

== Docker Setup

Before doing any deployment, its recommended to do `eval $(minishift docker-env)` from your current shell, to set up the DOCKER environment variables, that will be needed by the fabric8 maven plugin to deploy application on OpenShift.

[[iteration-1]]
= Iteration I

The Iteration-1 is supposed to be the as-is deployment of the __Brewery__ application on to https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes]
or https://www.openshift.com[Openshift].  This will have all the components from the original https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/brewery
with modifications required :

- Use the Fabric8 Maven Plugin to generate the Kubernetes/OpenShift resources needed to deploy the applications on the platform
- Design OpenShift templates to deploy RabbitMQ and the different servers such as Eureka, Config-Server, Zipkin, ... (to be discussed)

to have it deployed on to https://kubernetes.io[Kubernetes] or https://www.openshift.com[Openshift]

[[itr1-application-setup]]
== Setup

[[itr1-clone-source]]
=== Clone

[source,sh]
----
git clone -b iteration-1 https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/brewery.git
----

[NOTE]
====
Through out this document we will call the directory where the project was cloned as _$PROJECT_HOME_
====

[[itr1-pre-req]]
== Pre-Requisite

[[itr1-pre-req-rabbitmq]]
=== RabbitMQ 

The https://hub.docker.com/_/rabbitmq/[RabbimtMQ] container image when run is run using `root` user (UID `0`).  The OpenShift by default does not allow container 
images to be run with UID `0`. In order to allow that we need to define polices and attach to Kubernetes Service Account, to have better clarity and control 
we create a separate service account called **brewery** and add the required https://docs.openshift.org/latest/admin_guide/manage_scc.html[Security Context Constraints(SCC)] 
to allow running the container as UID `0` user.  The following commands adds the required SCC to the service account **brewery**,

[source,sh]
----
oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z brewery <1>

oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z brewery  <1>
----

<1> **brewery** service is created when RabbitMQ is deployed

[[itr1-build-app]]
=== Building

Brewery application uses gradle for build, we will leverage on the same to get the application artifacts ready. To build the applicaiton
run the following command

[source,sh]
----
./gradlew -DWHAT_TO_TEST="SLEUTH_STREAM" clean build <1>
./mvnw -N install <2>
----

<1> We will be using https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-sleuth/[Spring Cloud Sleuth] for sending trace information to https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin[Zipkin]
<2> This will install the brewery parent pom in local maven repository

[[itr1-deploy-to-openshift]]
=== Deploying to OpenShift

[WARNING]
====
As part of this lift and shift i.e to make existing application to work **as-is**, there is certain order of application deployment might be required.  
The order below is not hard rule but the best known working order during the migration effort. 
====

[[rabbitmq]]
==== RabbitMQ

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/extras/rabbitmq*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw -Dfabric8.mode=kubernetes clean fabric8:deploy
----

This will take some time to get it running as the deployment needs to download the `rabbitmq` docker image

[[config-server]]
==== Config Server

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/config-server*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw clean fabric8:deploy
----

NOTE: Since this is the first Java application to be deployed,  it may take some time to download the necessary images from docker hub.

[[eureka]]
==== Eureka

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/eureka*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw clean fabric8:deploy
----

[[zipkin-server]]

Go to the directory  *$PROJECT_HOME/zipkin-server*, and execute the following command

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw clean fabric8:deploy
